# Dark Web Threat Monitoring System

## Overview
This project scrapes known .onion websites via the Tor network, searching for threat-related keywords like "password", "exploit", and "credit card". It logs detected threats for monitoring potential data leaks or malicious activity.

## Setup
- Install [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) and start it.
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install requests[socks]`
- Run the script `python scrape_tor.py`
